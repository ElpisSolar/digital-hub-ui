        <!--<h3><u>How it works:</u></h3>-->
        <p>You are accessing this digital-hub through a Raspberry Pi, a small computer, contained within all of our
          solar-powered units. It has an integrated Wi-Fi module through which we can create a Wireless Access Point
          (WAP). Using the WAP, we are able to turn this low cost computer into a server, and thereby can provide a host
          of digital content to nearby mobile phone users such as yourself.</p><br>

        <!--<h3><u>The Digital-Hub:</u></h3>-->
        <p>What brings it all together is the digital hub, a user-interface that allows people to access the content
          stored on our devices through their mobile phones. So far we have deployed Arabic digital-hubs across refugee
          camps in Greece containing informational guides on mental health, women's healthcare, and a library of
          e-books, ranging from educational textbooks to childrenâ€™s books. Our goal is to gather and deploy content for
          all geographical contexts, and work closely with users to provide the most useful content possible.</p>
        <h5>Contact us:</h5>
        <p>We are always looking to improve our offerings to you. Whether it is specific types of digital content suited to your needs,
          or improvements to the solar infrastructure we provide (solar charging stations), we value your opinion! To contact us please
          visit our website at <span style="color: royalblue;">www.elpissolar.com</span> and click on the <b>contact us</b> button. Alternatively please leave any feedback you 
          have regarding this service with the person who is operating the solar mobile phone charging business.
